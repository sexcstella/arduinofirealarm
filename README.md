Fire Alarm IOT project by N. Sagnoy, E. Vasaya, and S. Salazar


## About this project
Fire Alarm is our IOT project that detects potential fire through 
analyzing temperature and detection of smoke and heat. The user would be able to know the current temperature and would alarm the owner if the device detects a fire within the range of the device, the user can also manually turn off the device when the device causes a false alarm.

The Device would also send temperature inputs to a database for the owner to use in the event that the user would like to know the temperature within a certain time frame.
